Git concepts I was *struggling* with were how and why to make feature branches.  

That concept was **very** much clarified for me during the GPS

I asked a **lot** of questions both theoretical and practical - one i remember was the difference between pulling and the two step fetch and merge process

I feel pretty good about Git actually

I had fun!  It was probably a unique experience because it was just me and an instructor.  I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.  It was fun to get to practice and ask questions.
